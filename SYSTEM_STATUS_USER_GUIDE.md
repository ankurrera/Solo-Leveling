# System Status - User Guide

## What is the System Status Page?

The System Status page is your RPG-style training dashboard. It tracks your real gym progress and presents it like a video game character sheet. **All numbers are real** - no fake stats or manual editing.

## Understanding Your Stats

### Your Level
Your level represents overall training progression. You gain XP (Experience Points) by completing workout sessions. The harder you work (more weight, more sets, longer sessions), the more XP you earn.

**How to Level Up:**
- Level 1→2 requires 100 XP
- Level 2→3 requires 200 XP  
- Level 3→4 requires 300 XP
- And so on...

### Core Stats (0-100 Scale)

#### 💪 Strength (STR)
**What it means:** Your progressive overload and total volume lifted

**How to increase it:**
- Lift heavier weights over time
- Complete more training sessions
- Increase total volume (weight × reps)

**Example:** If you increase your bench press from 50kg to 60kg, your Strength will go up.

#### 🏃 Endurance (END)
**What it means:** Your training capacity and stamina

**How to increase it:**
- Train for longer durations
- Perform more total reps
- Maintain consistent session lengths

**Example:** Going from 30-minute to 60-minute workouts will boost Endurance.

#### 😴 Recovery (REC)
**What it means:** How well you're balancing training and rest

**How to increase it:**
- Take rest days (don't train 7 days/week)
- Train 3-4 days per week (optimal)
- Avoid long training gaps

**Warning:** Recovery DECREASES if you:
- Train more than 5 days per week (overtraining)
- Don't train for more than 7 days (deconditioning)

#### 📅 Consistency (CON)
**What it means:** How regularly you stick to training

**How to increase it:**
- Complete at least 3 sessions per week
- Don't skip planned workouts
- Train regularly throughout the month

**Target:** 12 sessions per month = 100% consistency

#### 🤸 Mobility (MOB)
**What it means:** Exercise variety and movement patterns

**How to increase it:**
- Try different exercises
- Vary your workout routines
- Include diverse movement patterns

### Health Bar
The Health Bar shows your **system balance**. It's calculated as:
```
Health = (Recovery + Endurance + Consistency) / 3
```

**What it tells you:**
- 🟢 80-100: You're crushing it! Perfect balance.
- 🟡 60-79: Doing well, keep it up
- 🟠 40-59: Pay attention to recovery or consistency
- 🔴 0-39: Risk of overtraining or falling off track

## The XP System

### How You Earn XP
Every completed workout gives you XP based on:
1. **Total Volume:** Weight lifted × reps
2. **Session Duration:** How long you trained

**Formula:** XP = (volume / 100) + (duration × 0.5)

**Real Example:**
```
Workout: 
- Bench Press: 50kg × 12 reps × 3 sets = 1,800kg volume
- Duration: 60 minutes

XP Earned = (1,800 / 100) + (60 × 0.5) = 18 + 30 = 48 XP
```

### Important XP Rules
✅ **You earn XP when:**
- You complete a workout session
- You log exercises and sets

❌ **You DON'T earn XP when:**
- Editing an old workout
- Just browsing the app
- Updating workout notes

## Skill Points
**What are they?**
Skill Points = Total XP ÷ 10

They're just a visual representation of your accumulated effort. You can't spend them - they're for motivation!

## The Calendar

The calendar shows:
- 🟦 **Blue dates:** Days you trained
- ⚪ **Gray dates:** Rest days
- 🔵 **Outlined date:** Today

You can navigate months to see your training history.

## Goals

Goals automatically track your progress:
- Set a target (e.g., "Bench 100kg")
- The system watches your workout logs
- Progress updates automatically

**Note:** Goals are manual for now - you update current_value in your profile settings.

## Potions & Items

These represent your training **behavior patterns**, not actual items:

| Icon | Name | What It Counts |
|------|------|----------------|
| 🌙 | Rest Days | Rest days in last 30 days |
| 💧 | Consistency | Weeks with 3+ training sessions |
| ✨ | Deload Weeks | Recovery weeks (1-2 sessions) |
| ❤️ | Balance | Good recovery patterns |

**These are earned automatically** through your training habits. You can't buy them or boost them manually.

## Common Questions

### "Why don't my stats change when I edit a workout?"
Stats are calculated when you **complete** a session, not when you edit it. This prevents gaming the system and ensures stats reflect real effort.

### "How do I increase my stats faster?"
You can't cheat the system! Stats increase through:
- Consistent training (3-4 days/week)
- Progressive overload (gradually increasing weight)
- Balanced recovery (not overtraining)
- Exercise variety

### "What's the ideal training frequency?"
3-4 sessions per week is optimal for most stats, especially Recovery and Consistency. Training every day will actually *decrease* your Recovery stat.

### "Can I reset my stats?"
No. Stats are permanent records of your real training. If you want to start fresh, you'd need to delete all your workout history (not recommended!).

### "My Health bar is red. What should I do?"
Low health usually means:
- You're overtraining (training too many days without rest)
- You're inconsistent (long gaps between sessions)
- Your endurance or recovery is low

**Solution:** Take a rest day if overtraining, or get back to regular training if you've had a long gap.

## Tips for Progression

1. **Be Consistent:** Train 3-4 times per week
2. **Progressive Overload:** Gradually increase weights
3. **Take Rest Days:** Your body needs recovery
4. **Track Everything:** Log all sets and reps accurately
5. **Vary Exercises:** Try different movements for Mobility
6. **Don't Overtrain:** More isn't always better

## The Philosophy

This system is designed to:
- Reward real effort, not fake numbers
- Encourage balanced training
- Prevent overtraining through the Recovery stat
- Make training feel like a game, but based on reality

**Remember:** The system observes your effort over time. It doesn't lie. It doesn't rush. Train smart, train consistently, and watch your character grow!
